Define NAME as a function.
Like normal `defun', except ARGLIST allows full Common Lisp conventions,
and BODY is implicitly surrounded by (block NAME ...).

\"Full Common Lisp conventions\" means that:

-- In addition to &optional and &rest, the lambda-list keywords &key,
   &allow-other-keys, and &aux are allowed.

-- The format of the arguments to &optional is expanded: As well as simple
   variables, they can be lists of the form (VAR [INITFORM [SVAR]]); when
   no argument is available for VAR, INITFORM is evaluated (or nil, if
   INITFORM is omitted) and stored as VAR's value, and SVAR is bound to t.
   If an argument is available for VAR, and INITFORM is unused, SVAR is
   bound to nil.

-- &key specifies keyword arguments.  The format of each argument is
   VAR || ( { VAR || (KEYWORD VAR) } [INITFORM [SVAR]]).  

   If VAR is specified on its own, VAR is bound within BODY to the value
   supplied by the caller for the corresponding keyword; for example, &key
   my-value means callers write :my-value RUNTIME-EXPRESSION.

   If (VAR INITFORM) is specified, INITFORM is an expression evaluated at
   runtime to determine a default value for VAR.

   If (VAR INITFORM SVAR) is specified, SVAR is variable available within
   BODY that is non-nil if VAR was explicitly specified in the calling
   expression.

   If ((KEYWORD VAR)) is specified, KEYWORD is the keyword to be used by
   callers, and VAR is the corresponding variable binding within BODY.

   In calls to NAME, values for a given keyword may be supplied multiple
   times.  The first value is the only one used.

-- &allow-other-keys means that if other keyword arguments are given that are
   not specifically list in the arg list, they are allowed, rather than an
   error being signalled.  They can be retrieved with an &rest form.

-- &aux specifies extra bindings, exactly like a `let*' enclosing the body.
   The format of each binding is VAR || (VAR [INITFORM]) -- exactly like the
   format of `let'/`let*' bindings.

" nil 'macro)

(autoload 'defmacro* "cl-macs" "\
Define NAME as a macro.
Like normal `defmacro', except ARGLIST allows full Common Lisp conventions,
and BODY is implicitly surrounded by (block NAME ...).

\"Full Common Lisp conventions\" means that:

-- The lambda-list keywords &optional, &rest, &key, &allow-other-keys, and
   &aux are allowed, as in `defun*'.

-- Three additional lambda-list keywords are allowed: &body, &whole, and
   &environment:

   &body is equivalent to &rest, but is intended to indicate that the
   following arguments are the body of some piece of code, and should be
   indented as such.

   &whole must come first; it is followed by a single variable that, at
   macro expansion time, reflects all the arguments supplied to the macro,
   as if it had been declared with a single &rest argument.

   &environment allows access to the macro environment at the time of
   expansion; it is most relevant when it's necessary to force macro expansion
   of the body of a form at the time of macro expansion of its top level.
   &environment is followed by variable name, and this variable will be bound
   to the value of the macro environment within BODY. See the ENVIRONMENT
   argument to `macroexpand'.

-- The macro arg list syntax allows for \"destructuring\" -- see also
   `destructuring-bind', which destructures exactly like `defmacro*', and
   `loop', which does a rather different way of destructuring.  Anywhere
   that a simple argument may appear, and (if following a lambda-list
   keyword) a list may not normally appear, an embedded lambda list can be
   substituted.  (The format of the embedded lambda list is exactly the
   same as for a top-level list except that &environment is not allowed.)
   When matching this lambda list against a caller-specified argument, that
   argument is treated as a list and normal lambda-list processing occurs,
   just as if the entire operation were happening at top level.
   Furthermore, any lambda list, embedded or top-level, can be dotted at its
   end, and this will cause matching with an appropriate dotted list given
   as an argument.

   See `loop' for practical examples of destructuring, but
   keep in mind that `loop' destructuring is somewhat different from macro
   destructuring in that

   (a) Macro destructuring has extra features in the various lambda-list
       keywords, allowing for special processing of a list other than just
       simple matching.
   (b) Macro destructuring is strict, in that an error is signalled if the
       actual structure does not match the expected structure.  On the
       other hand, loop destructuring is lax -- extra arguments in a list
       are ignored, not enough arguments cause the remaining parameters to
       receive a value of nil, etc.

in `defmacro*'; see that for more information.

An alternative means of destructuring is using the `loop' macro. `loop'
gives practical examples of destructuring.  `defmacro*' describes the
differences between loop and macro-style destructuring.

You can rewrite a call to (destructuring-bind ARGS EXPR &rest BODY) using

(autoload 'loop "cl-macs" "\
The Common Lisp `loop' macro.

The loop macro consists of a series of clauses, which do things like
iterate variables, set conditions for exiting the loop, accumulating values
to be returned as the return value of the loop, and executing arbitrary
blocks of code.  Each clause is processed in turn, and the loop executes its
body repeatedly until an exit condition is hit.

It's important to understand that loop clauses such as `for' and `while',
which look like loop-establishing constructs, don't actually *establish* a
loop; the looping is established by the `loop' clause itself, which will
repeatedly process its body until told to stop.  `while' merely establishes
a condition which, when true, causes the loop to finish, and `for' sets a
variable to different values on each iteration (e.g. successive elements of
a list) and sets an exit condition when there are no more values.  This
means, for example, that if two `for' clauses appear, you don't get two
nested loops, but instead two variables that are stepped in parallel, and
two exit conditions, either of which, if triggered, will cause the loop to
end.  Similarly for a loop with a `for' and a `while' clause.  For example:

\(loop
  for x in list
  while x
  do ...)

In each successive iteration, X is set to the next element of the list.  If
there are no more elements, or if any element is nil (the `while' clause),
the loop exits.  Otherwise, the block of code following `do' is executed.)

This example also shows that some clauses establish variable bindings --
essentially like a `let' binding -- and that following clauses can
reference these variables.  Furthermore, the entire loop is surrounded by a
block named nil (unless the `named' clause is given), so you can return
from the loop using the macro `return'. (The other way to exit the loop is
through the macro `loop-finish'.  The difference is that some loop clauses
establish or accumulate a value to be returned, and `loop-finish' returns
this. `return', however, can only return an explicitly-specified value.
NOTE CAREFULLY: There is a loop clause called `return' as well as a
standard Lisp macro called `return'.  Normally they work similarly; but if
you give the loop a name with `named', you will need to use the macro
`return-from'.)

Another extremely useful feature of loops is called \"destructuring\".  If,
in place of VAR, a list (possibly dotted, possibly a tree of arbitrary
complexity) is given, the value to be assigned is assumed to have a similar
structure to the list given, and variables in the list will be matched up
with corresponding elements in the structure.  For example:

\(loop
  for (x y) in '((foo 1) (bar 2) (baz 3))
  do (puthash x y some-hash-table))

will add three elements to a hash table, mapping foo -> 1, bar -> 2, and
baz -> 3.  As other examples, you can conveniently process alists using

\(loop for (x . y) in alist do ...)

and plists using

\(loop for (x y) on plist by #'cddr do ...)

Destructuring is forgiving in that mismatches in the number of elements on
either size will be handled gracefully, either by ignoring or initializing
to nil.  Destructuring is extremely powerful, and is probably the single
most useful feature of `loop'.

Other useful features of loops are iterating over hash-tables, collecting values into lists, and being able to modify lists in-place as you iterate over them.  As an example of the first two,

\(loop for x being the hash-key in table using (hash-value y)
  collect (cons x y))

converts hash-table TABLE to an alist. (What `collect' actually does is
push its value onto the end of an internal list and establish this list as
the default return value of the loop.  See below for more information.)

An example of in-place modification is

\(setq foo '(1 3 5))
\(loop for x in-ref foo do
  (setf x (* x x)))

after which foo will contain '(1 9 25).

If you don't understand how a particular loop clause works, create an
example and use `macroexpand-sexp' to expand the macro.

Valid clauses are:

\(NOTE: Keywords in lowercase; slashes separate different possibilities
for keywords, some of which are synonymous; brackets indicate optional
parts of the clause.  In all of the clauses with `being', the word `being',
the words `each' or `the', and the difference between singular and plural
keywords are all just syntactic sugar.  Stylistically, you should write
either `being each foo' or `being the foos'.)

    Step VAR across numbers.  `upfrom', `upto', and `below' explicitly
    indicate upward stepping; `downfrom', `downto', and `above' explicitly
    indicate downward stepping. (If none of these is given, the default is
    upward.) `to', `upto', and `downto' cause stepping to include NUM2 as
    the last iteration, while `above' and `below' stop just before reaching
    NUM2.  `by' can be given to indicate a stepping increment other than 1.

  for VAR in LIST [by FUNC]
    Step VAR over elements of a LIST.  FUNC specifies how to get successive
    sublists and defaults to `cdr'.

  for VAR on LIST [by FUNC]
    Step VAR over tails of a LIST.  FUNC specifies how to get successive
    sublists and defaults to `cdr'.

  for VAR in-ref LIST [by FUNC]
    Step VAR over elements of a LIST, like `for ... in', except the VAR is
    bound using `symbol-macrolet' instead of `let'.  In essence, VAR is set
    to a \"reference\" to the list element instead of the element itself;
    this us, you can destructively modify the list using `setf' on VAR, and
    any changes to the list will \"magically\" reflect themselves in
    subsequent uses of VAR.

  for VAR = INIT [then EXPR]
    Set VAR on each iteration of the loop.  If only INIT is given, use it
    on each iteration.  Otherwise, use INIT on the first iteration and EXPR
    on subsequent ones.

  for VAR across/across-ref ARRAY
    Step VAR across a sequence other than a list (string, vector, bit
    vector).  If `across-ref' is given, VAR is bound using
    `symbol-macrolet' instead of `let' -- see above.

  for VAR being each/the element/elements in/of/in-ref/of-ref SEQUENCE [using (index INDEX-VAR)]
    Step VAR across any sequence.  A variable can be specified with a
    `using' phrase to receive the index, starting at 0.  If `in-ref' or
    `of-ref' is given, VAR is bound using `symbol-macrolet' instead of
    `let' -- see above.

  for VAR being each/the hash-key/hash-keys/hash-value/hash-values in/of HASH-TABLE [using (hash-value/hash-key OTHER-VAR)]

  for VAR being each/the hash-key/hash-keys/hash-value/hash-values in/of HASH-TABLE [using (hash-value/hash-key OTHER-VAR)]
    Map VAR over a hash table.  The various keywords are synonymous except
    those that distinguish between keys and values.  The `using' phrase is
    optional and allows both key and value to be bound.

  for VAR being each/the symbol/present-symbol/external-symbol/symbols/present-symbols/external-symbols in/of OBARRAY
    Map VAR over the symbols in an obarray.  All symbol keywords are
    currently synonymous.

  for VAR being each/the extent/extents [in/of BUFFER-OR-STRING] [from POS] [to POS]
    Map VAR over the extents in a buffer or string, defaulting to the
    current buffer, the beginning and the end, respectively.

  for VAR being each/the interval/intervals [in/of BUFFER-OR-STRING] [property PROPERTY] [from POS] [to POS]
    Map VAR over the intervals without property change in a buffer or
    string, defaulting to the current buffer, the beginning and the end,
    respectively.  If PROPERTY is given, iteration occurs using
    `next-single-property-change'; otherwise, using
    `next-property-change'.

  for VAR being each/the window/windows [in/of FRAME]
    Step VAR over the windows in FRAME, defaulting to the selected frame.

  for VAR being each/the frame/frames
    Step VAR over all frames.

  for VAR being each/the buffer/buffers [by FUNC]
    Step VAR over all buffers.  This is actually equivalent to
    `for VAR in (buffer-list) [by FUNC]'.

  for VAR being each/the key-code/key-codes/key-seq/key-seqs/key-binding/key-bindings in KEYMAP [using (key-code/key-codes/key-seq/key-seqs/key-binding/key-bindings OTHER-VAR)]
    Map VAR over the entries in a keymap.  Keyword `key-seq' causes
    recursive mapping over prefix keymaps occurring in the keymap, with VAR
    getting the built-up sequence (a vector).  Otherwise, mapping does not
    occur recursively.  `key-code' and `key-seq' refer to what is bound
    (second argument of `define-key'), and `key-binding' what it's bound to
    (third argument of `define-key').

  as VAR ...
    `as' is a synonym for `for'.

  and VAR ...
    `and' clauses have the same syntax as `for' clauses except that the
    variables in the clause are bound in parallel with a preceding
    `and'/`for' clause instead of in series.

  with VAR = INIT
    Set VAR to INIT once, before doing any iterations.

  repeat NUM
    Exit the loop if more than NUM iterations have occurred.

  while COND
    Exit the loop if COND isn't true.

  until COND
    Exit the loop if COND is true.

  collect EXPR [into VAR]
    Push EXPR onto the end of a list of values -- stored either in VAR or a
    temporary variable that will be returned as the return value of the
    loop if it terminates through an exit condition or a call to
    `loop-finish'.

  append EXPR [into VAR]
    Append EXPR (a list) onto the end of a list of values, like `collect'.

  nconc EXPR [into VAR]
    Nconc EXPR (a list) onto the end of a list of values, like `collect'.

  concat EXPR [into VAR]
    Concatenate EXPR (a string) onto the end of a string of values, like
    `collect'.

  vconcat EXPR [into VAR]
    Concatenate EXPR (a vector) onto the end of a vector of values, like
    `collect'.

  bvconcat EXPR [into VAR]
    Concatenate EXPR (a bit vector) onto the end of a bit vector of values,
    like `collect'.

  sum EXPR [into VAR]
    Add EXPR to a value, like `collect'.

  count EXPR [into VAR]
    If EXPR is true, increment a value by 1, like `collect'.

  maximize EXPR [into VAR]
    IF EXPR is greater than a value, replace the value with EXPR, like
    `collect'.

  minimize EXPR [into VAR]
    IF EXPR is less than a value, replace the value with EXPR, like
    `collect'.

  always COND
    If COND is true, continue the loop and set the loop return value (the
    same value that's manipulated by `collect' and friends and is returned
    by a normal loop exit or an exit using `loop-finish') to t; otherwise,
    exit the loop and return nil.  The effect is to determine and return
    whether a condition is true \"always\" (all iterations of the loop).

  never COND
    If COND is false, continue the loop and set the loop return value (like
    `always') to t; otherwise, exit the loop and return nil.  The effect
    is to determine and return whether a condition is \"never\" true (all
    iterations of the loop).

  thereis COND
    If COND is true, exit the loop and return COND.

  if/when COND CLAUSE [and CLAUSE]... else CLAUSE [and CLAUSE...]
    If COND is true, execute the directly following clause(s); otherwise,
    execute the clauses following `else'.

  unless COND CLAUSE [and CLAUSE]... else CLAUSE [and CLAUSE...]
    If COND is false, execute the directly following clause(s); otherwise, execute the clauses following `else'.

  do EXPRS...
    Execute the expressions (any Lisp forms).

  initially EXPRS...
    Execute EXPR once, before doing any iterations, and after values have
    been set using `with'.

  finally EXPRS...
    Execute EXPR once, directly before the loop terminates.  This will not
    be executed if the loop terminates prematurely as a result of `always',
    `never', `thereis', or `return'.

  return EXPR
    Exit from the loop and return EXPR.

  finally return EXPR
    Specify the value to be returned when the loop exits. (Unlike `return',
    this doesn't cause the loop to immediately exit; it will exit whenever
    it normally would have.) This takes precedence over a return value
    specified with `collect' and friends or `always' and friends.

  named NAME
    Specify the name for block surrounding the loop, in place of nil.
    (See `block'.)

Alternate form: (defsetf NAME ARGLIST (STORE) BODY...).
Here, the above `setf' call is expanded by binding the argument forms ARGS
according to ARGLIST, binding the value form VAL to STORE, then executing
BODY, which must return a Lisp form that does the necessary `setf' operation.
Actually, ARGLIST and STORE may be bound to temporary variables which are

contravention of Common Lisp, where `flet' makes a lexical, not a dynamic,

Normally you should use `labels', not `flet'; `labels' does not have the
problems caused by dynamic scope, is less expensive when byte-compiled, and
allows lexical shadowing of functions with byte-codes and byte-compile
methods, where `flet' will fail.  The byte-compiler will warn when this
happens.

                        starting with the ANCHOR-MATCHER.

 POST-MATCH-FORM    :== Like PRE-MATCH-FORM, but used to clean up after the
                        ANCHOR-MATCHER.  It might be used to move, before
                        resuming with MATCH-ANCHORED's parent's MATCHER.

For example, an element of the first form highlights (if not already highlighted):

  \"\\\\\\=<foo\\\\\\=>\"                    Discrete occurrences of \"foo\" in the value
                                 of the variable `font-lock-keyword-face'.

  (\"fu\\\\(bar\\\\)\" . 1)            Substring \"bar\" within all occurrences of
                                 \"fubar\" in the value of
                                 `font-lock-keyword-face'.

  (\"fubar\" . fubar-face)         Occurrences of \"fubar\" in the value of
                                 `fubar-face'.

  (\"foo\\\\|bar\" 0 foo-bar-face t) Occurrences of either \"foo\" or \"bar\" in the
                                 value of `foo-bar-face', even if already
                                 highlighted.

  (fubar-match 1 fubar-face)     The first subexpression within all
                                 occurrences of whatever the function
                                 `fubar-match' finds and matches in the value
                                 of `fubar-face'.

  (\"\\\\\\=<anchor\\\\\\=>\" (0 anchor-face) (\"\\\\\\=<item\\\\\\=>\" nil nil (0 item-face)))
   -------------- ---------------  ------------ --- --- -------------
       |            |               |            |   |          |
   MATCHER          |         ANCHOR-MATCHER     |   +------+ MATCH-HIGHLIGHT
             MATCH-HIGHLIGHT                 PRE-MATCH-FORM |
                                                           POST-MATCH-FORM

  Discrete occurrences of \"anchor\" in the value of `anchor-face', and
  subsequent discrete occurrences of \"item\" (on the same line) in the value
  of `item-face'.  (Here PRE-MATCH-FORM and POST-MATCH-FORM are nil.
  Therefore \"item\" is initially searched for starting from the end of the
  match of \"anchor\", and searching for subsequent instance of \"anchor\"
  resumes from where searching for \"item\" concluded.)

For highlighting single items, typically only MATCH-HIGHLIGHT is required.
However, if an item or (typically) several items are to be highlighted
following the instance of another item (the anchor) then MATCH-ANCHORED may be
required.

These regular expressions should not match text which spans lines.  While
\\[font-lock-fontify-buffer] handles multi-line patterns correctly, updating when you
edit the buffer does not, since it considers text one line at a time.

Be very careful composing regexps for this list; the wrong pattern can
dramatically slow things down!

(defvar font-lock-syntactic-keywords nil "\
A list of the syntactic keywords to highlight.
Can be the list or the name of a function or variable whose value is the list.
See `font-lock-keywords' for a description of the form of this list;
the differences are listed below.  MATCH-HIGHLIGHT should be of the form:

 (MATCH SYNTAX OVERRIDE LAXMATCH)

where SYNTAX can be of the form (SYNTAX-CODE . MATCHING-CHAR), the name of a
syntax table, or an expression whose value is such a form or a syntax table.
OVERRIDE cannot be `prepend' or `append'.

For example, an element of the form highlights syntactically:

 (\"\\\\$\\\\(#\\\\)\" 1 (1 . nil))

 a hash character when following a dollar character, with a SYNTAX-CODE of
 1 (meaning punctuation syntax).  Assuming that the buffer syntax table does
 specify hash characters to have comment start syntax, the element will only
 highlight hash characters that do not follow dollar characters as comments
 syntactically.

 (\"\\\\('\\\\).\\\\('\\\\)\"
  (1 (7 . ?'))
  (2 (7 . ?')))

 both single quotes which surround a single character, with a SYNTAX-CODE of
 7 (meaning string quote syntax) and a MATCHING-CHAR of a single quote (meaning
 a single quote matches a single quote).  Assuming that the buffer syntax table
 does not specify single quotes to have quote syntax, the element will only
 highlight single quotes of the form 'c' as strings syntactically.
 Other forms, such as foo'bar or 'fubar', will not be highlighted as strings.

This is normally set via `font-lock-defaults'.")

Get information about a package.

Quite similar to `package-get-info-prop', but can retrieve a lot more
information.

Argument PACKAGE is the name of an XEmacs package (a symbol).  It must
be a valid package, ie, a member of `package-get-base'.

Argument INFORMATION is a symbol that can be any one of:

   standards-version     Package system version (not used).
   version               Version of the XEmacs package.
   author-version        The upstream version of the package.
   date                  The date the package was last modified.
   build-date            The date the package was last built.
   maintainer            The maintainer of the package.
   distribution          Will always be \"xemacs\" (not used).
   priority              \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\" (not used).
   category              Either \"standard\", \"mule\", or \"unsupported\"..
   dump                  Is the package dumped (not used).
   description           A description of the package.
   filename              The filename of the binary tarball of the package.
   md5sum                The md5sum of filename.
   size                  The size in bytes of filename.
   provides              A list of symbols that this package provides.
   requires              A list of packages that this package requires.
   type                  Can be either \"regular\" or \"single-file\".

Optional argument ARG is a prefix arg.  Without a value, ie, just
doing `C-u M-x package-get-info' will insert the information at point
in the current buffer using a local package list.

ARG can also be given a value of 2 or 3.  If 2, use a remote package
list, displaying the information in the minubuffer.  If 3, use a remote
package list and insert the information at point in the current buffer.

If optional argument REMOTE is non-nil use a package list from a
remote site.  

To use a remote package list, either via the prefix argument ARG or
via the REMOTE argument `package-get-remote' must be non-nil.  If
`package-get-remote' is nil, the local package list will be used.

If this function is called interactively it will display INFORMATION
in the minibuffer.

arguments: (PACKAGE INFORMATION &optional ARG REMOTE)
" t nil)

(autoload 'package-get-list-packages-where "package-get" "\
Return a list of packages that fulfill certain criteria.

Argument ITEM, a symbol, is what you want to check for.  ITEM must be a
symbol even when it doesn't make sense to be a symbol (think, searching
maintainers, descriptions, etc).  The function will convert the symbol
to a string if a string is what is needed.  The downside to this is that
ITEM can only ever be a single word.

Argument FIELD, a symbol, is the field to check in.  You can specify
any one of:

      Field            Sane or Allowable Content
    description          any single word
    category             `standard' or `mule'
    maintainer           any single word
    build-date           yyyy-mm-dd

    priority             `low', `medium', or `high'

current buffer.

(autoload 'package-get "package-get" "\
Fetch PACKAGE from remote site.
Optional arguments VERSION indicates which version to retrieve, nil
means most recent version.  CONFLICT indicates what happens if the
package is already installed.  Valid values for CONFLICT are:
'always	always retrieve the package even if it is already installed
'never	do not retrieve the package if it is installed.
INSTALL-DIR, if non-nil, specifies the package directory where
fetched packages should be installed.

The value of `package-get-base' is used to determine what files should
be retrieved.  The value of `package-get-remote' is used to determine
where a package should be retrieved from.

Once the package is retrieved, its md5 checksum is computed.  If that
sum does not match that stored in `package-get-base' for this version
of the package, an error is signalled.

Returns `t' upon success, the symbol `error' if the package was
successfully installed but errors occurred during initialization, or
`nil' upon error.

Return a regexp to match a string in STRINGS.
Each string should be unique in STRINGS and should not contain any regexps,
quoted or not.  If optional PAREN is non-nil, ensure that the returned regexp
is enclosed by at least one regexp grouping construct.
The returned regexp is typically more efficient than the equivalent regexp:

 (let ((open (if PAREN \"\\\\(\" \"\")) (close (if PAREN \"\\\\)\" \"\")))
   (concat open (mapconcat 'regexp-quote STRINGS \"\\\\|\") close))

;;;### (autoloads (list-load-path-shadows) "shadow" "lisp/shadow.el")

(autoload 'list-load-path-shadows "shadow" "\
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

This function lists potential load-path problems.  Directories in the
`load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is \"hidden\" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

\(\"/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp\" \"/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp\")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
\(require 'XXX), (autoload .... \"XXX\"), (load-library \"XXX\") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via load-file).

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of emacs prior to
19.30.  An emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the emacs distribution.
Unless the emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
\(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

When run interactively, the shadowings (if any) are displayed in a
buffer called `*Shadows*'.  Shadowings are located by calling the
\(non-interactive) companion function, `find-emacs-lisp-shadows'.
